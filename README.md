# Bogaudio_Darktheme_062c

This repo ccontains only the darkgray colored SVG files for the Bogaudio Modules plugin, for VCV Rack 0.6.2c

These edits are not maintained nor supported by Bogaudio.

To use these files simply unzip res_dark.zip to your Bogaudio Modules plugin folder, rename the there folder that is called "res" to "res_backup". Then rename the unzipped folder "res_dark" to "res".

This should work as there is nothing changed in the functionality of the plugin. If you run into problems or aren't sure of what you have done, simply delete the entire Bogaudio Modules plugin folder from the VCV plugin v1 folder. And sync the plugins from within VCV to re-download Bogaudio Modules.
